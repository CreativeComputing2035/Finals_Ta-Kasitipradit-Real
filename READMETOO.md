Ariel,
Taking from what I've done for my midterm, my goal is to try to insert myself more into my website. I create two new interactive aspects.
One is when you hover over my main menu "work and sketchbook" background of the website will chagne color. THe other one is that in every page the mouse will have
a paragraph of text following it everywhere. These texts contain fun fact about who i am and my identity. This is to give the viewer another layer of who i am
